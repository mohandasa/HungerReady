# HungerReady
Design a system (HungeReady) to support and automate a merchant’s (restaurant in our case) front and back of house operations. Design a mobile-app (HungeReadyToDrive?) for delivery drivers. 

How it works

HungeReady 

basically helps the merchant organize his orders and manage deliveries within his business. 
This includes monitoring delivery, dine-in and pick-up requests. 
The system also tracks HungeReadyToDrive? drivers that accept delivery requests posted via HungeReadyToDrive?.  

HungeReadyToDrive? 

links to a particular HungeReady user’s system when he receives a request for delivery and accepts it. 
It gives drivers the flexibility to accept the delivery request if they are able to fulfill it. 
It is a platform that allows users to sign up as delivery drivers while also keeping a track of current deliveries, past deliveries and earnings.
